A very tall midget.

I know what the fox says.

elegance is an attitude.

go big or go home.

always give up what you are for what you could become.	

don't predict the future, invent it.

can't do great things? do small ones in a great way.

what's that?

g(r)o(w) through life.

the best way is always through.
